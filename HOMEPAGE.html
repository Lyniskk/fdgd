            <h2>FACTS</h2>
            <p>Baguio City is the summer capital of the Philippines and is also known as the City of Pines. The city was founded by the Americans in 1900 and officially declared the "Summer Capital" in 1909 to serve as their hill station in Asia, providing a place to escape Manila's heat. The same way that people from the lowlands come here around the ideal months of November to May to escape the heat and humidity. That being mentioned, the average temperature in Baguio is about 18.3 Degree Celsius, making it much cooler than lowland cities where temperatures can exceed 35 Degree Celsius. Baguio City is also well known for its strawberry delicacies and products and their delicious Benguet Coffee.</p>
